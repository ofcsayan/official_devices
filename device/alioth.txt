Changelogs For ProjectBlaze 3.7

- Synced Latest Blaze v3.7 changes
- Merged August ASB
- Fully Rebased common device tree 
- Dropped old style HBM and DC dimming and their kernel based implantation 
- Introducing new HBM and DC dimming. Credits @EmanuelCN
- Use game thermal as fallback for GameSpace's listed apps
 * This will apply the "gaming" thermal preset to the app that listed
at GameSpace's library, but aren't yet configured by user on thermal
settings.
With this behavior, we can get saner default on gaming scenarios without
having to force user choice.

- Reverted TOGGLEABLE_TILE in Dirac for now
- Moved thermal profiles to system settings
 * let's not pollute our beautiful battery settings menu

- Added thermal profiles tile
 * Launches ThermalActivity

- Tuned zram performance
 *Switch to LZ4 for better overall performance

- Set zram size to 50% of total ram
 * As recommended by CAF
- Silenced some spammy logging
- Allowed more cached apps in the background
- Increased wifi max bss count
- Enabled wifi QPower and Deep sleep at the same time
 * This enables Deep Sleep mode, additionally to QPower
 * With this configuration, QPower manages the new Deep sleep mode
 -> Leads to amazing power savings

- Enabled automatic channel selection
  * Automatic Channel Selection algorithms and implementations
   are used to enable interfaces to automatically figure
   out which channel configuration to use for initiating
   communication, for any mode of operation which initiates
   radiation (AP, Mesh, IBSS, P2P).

- Enabled support for IEEE80211AC
 * This is to allow supporting GO with 11AC support.

- Enabled support for IEEE80211AX
  * This is to allow supporting WiFi 6 mobile hotspots,
   to be noted this is only supported on SDM855+ platforms.
- Many Wifi improvments 

- Smarter wifi decisions on whether to use 2/5Ghz AP
 * Implement a smarter system on whether to connect to the provided 2Ghz or 5Ghz network
 
- Switch gEnablePowerSaveOffload to 5
 *This should improve VoIP calls performance

- Removed TxPower2g and 5g, because they weren't been used

- Addressed telephony denials

- Suppress warning related to NNAPI HAL accessing zeroth.debuglog.logmask

- Disable QCOM system daemon
 * For factory use only and has real performance costs.

- Remove unnecessary QTI logkit directories
 * We do not use logkit

- Strip off some debug packages
 * Ref: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/configure#compilation_options
 Q: PRODUCT_MINIMIZE_JAVA_DEBUG_INFO wth does this do?
 A: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/master/target/product/go_defaults_common.mk#68

- Address batterysecret denial
 * Even MIUI provides create file permission.

- Update pinner configuration 
 * Pin critical graphics libraries
Inspired from AOSPA/android_vendor_aospa@c33cdcb

- Set readahead_size_kb=128 to main partitions
 *To avoid memory pressure

- Offload WM shell to another thread
 * Android 12 added this config to offload some window management to a
dedicated thread. Enable it to improve performance when the main System
UI thread is busy.

- Set default wifi country code to '00'
* By default, AOSP uses the 'US' country code for wifi.

When a SIM is present, Android can check the correct country
(using information from the SIM itself) and it can set the correct
country code.

However, if no SIM is present or if the phone is in airplane mode,
Android will just use 'US' as country code and it will disable access to
a lot of frequencies.

To bypass this issue, set the default country code to '00': this
is the "world regulatory domain" and it contains generic settings.
When a SIM is inserted, Android will overwrite the default setting with
the correct country code.

Copy from Google:
https://android.googlesource.com/device/google/crosshatch/+/12b500667e5440345a7bd8237c38fa2839329c11/init.hardware.rc#524

- Don't pin launcher app in memory
 * Similar to what we did for the camera app, unpin the launcher app from
memory as well. While the default launcher (Launcher3) isn't
particularly big, it doesn't make much sense to pin because the launcher
does not typically load new resources much. Most of its resources should
already be loaded in memory after it starts, so pinning the APK is
redundant.

NB: The value has been changed to false instead of removing it entirely
because we need to override the config set by overlays in the prebuilt
vendor image.

- Change all three default haptic levels to high
 * Test: verify default haptic levels set to high on r4

- Enable suspend to RAM
 * Improves idle drain considerably

- Bind mount Wifi Aware feature permissions.
 * Fixes issues when GPS and Wifi are switched on simultaneously.
 * Also kills logspam regarding NAN.

- Wifi: set inactivity time
 * Wait for 1 second to let wifi driver do
   complete clean reset of SW/HW.
   Test: perform watchdog recovery and success

- Extend gInterfaceChangeWait to 2 seconds for avoid crash when "adb reboot"
 * Test: "adb reboot" test more than 4000 times and not hit crash as b/131123423
      Wifi work normally after the same test.

- Props: RIL edits for battery life
 * Changed “ro.ril.disable.power.collapse” value to zero.
   Seems to be a debate on what value is more effective but after more reading and testing found that a value of “0” shows more improvement.
   Have also added “ro.mot.eri.losalert.delay=1000 “ that helps smooth out disconnects and reconnects, saving battery.

- Add some libraries to pinner list
 * Add some librart which will load during camera launch to reduce camera
   launch time in I/O busy case.

- Overlay: Frameworks: Update pinner configuration
 * Drop unused 32-bit libs.
   Drop RS libs as they're deprecated since 12.
   Add few adreno (EGL) libs, taken from MIUI.
   Add libipebpsstriping170 for yupik camx.

- Reduced aod brightness value

- Silence OpenGLRenderer logspams

- props: Add more props for battery saving

- props: Clean up useless logspams

- Update Adreno to LA.UM.9.14.r1-20200-LAHAINA.QSSI13.0

- Update adreno blobs from LA.VENDOR.1.0.r1-16000-WAIPIO.QSSI13.0

- overlay: Tune max notification icons visible
 * Ref:
  - AOSPA/android_device_xiaomi_marble@3db7e76.
  - AOSPA/android_device_xiaomi_marble@7d57769.

- Powerhint: Set to powersave governor when device is idle
 * This should help improve drains while device on idle

- Disabled VT
 * Avoid unexpected hangups due to failure to establish a connection

- Switched to common libqti-perfd-client and power-libperfmgr

- Added advanced debugging tools to get logs even in userdebug/user builds
